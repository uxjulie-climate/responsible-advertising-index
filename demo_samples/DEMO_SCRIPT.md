## Demo Flow

### 1. Introduction (2 minutes)

**Opening:**
> "Today I'll show you the Responsible Advertising Index - an AI-powered tool that analyzes advertising across four responsibility dimensions: Climate, Social, Cultural, and Ethical."

**Key Points:**
- Analyzes both images and video
- Provides scores 0-100 per dimension
- Identifies specific issues with evidence
- Currently in research/validation phase

**Set Expectations:**
> "Important note: This is a research tool providing directional insights. Scores aren't validated for absolute precision yet - we're conducting expert validation over the next 6 months. Think of it as a compass that points the right direction, not a ruler with millimeter precision."

---

### 2. System Overview (2 minutes)

**Show:** Main interface with tabs

**Point Out:**
- **Image Analysis** - Upload ad images
- **Video Analysis** - Upload video ads (NEW!)
- **Compare Ads** - Side-by-side comparison
- **Export Data** - PDF/Excel reports

**Mention:**
- Bilingual support (English/Hungarian)

---

### 3. Example 1: Excellent Ad (5 minutes)

**Select:** "Excellent: Sustainable Fashion" (EcoThreads)

**Ad Copy to Show:**
> "Repair Revolution - Every EcoThreads garment comes with lifetime repair guarantee. Since 2019, we've repaired 14,000 items. 100% organic cotton, GOTS certified. Fair Trade certified. Buy less, wear longer."

**Click:** "Analyze Ad"

**While Analyzing (10-15 seconds):**
> "The AI is analyzing both the visual elements and the text copy. It's looking for sustainability claims, diversity in representation, cultural sensitivity, and ethical communication practices."

**Results to Highlight:**

**Overall Score: 91/100**
> "This scores very high. Let's see why..."

**Radar Chart:**
- Climate: 95
- Social: 90
- Cultural: 88
- Ethical: 92

**Key Findings to Read:**
- **Climate:** "Specific, verifiable claims: '14,000 items repaired' - not vague greenwashing"
- **Social:** "Fair Trade certification indicates worker welfare consideration"
- **Ethical:** "Anti-consumerist messaging - 'Buy less' is counter to typical advertising"

**Talking Point:**
> "Notice how the AI identifies SPECIFIC evidence from the ad. It's not just giving a score - it's explaining WHY. This is what makes it useful: actionable insights, not just numbers."

**Show Strengths/Concerns/Recommendations:**
> "The system also provides recommendations. Even good ads can improve."

---

### 4. Example 2: Problematic Ad (5 minutes)

**Select:** "Problematic: Weight Loss" (SlimFit Pro)

**Ad Copy:**
> "Get Your Dream Body in Just 30 Days! Tired of feeling uncomfortable in your own skin? Drop pounds fast. Before: Unhappy. After: Unstoppable. Limited time: Buy 2, Get 1 FREE. Results may vary."

**Click:** "Analyze Ad"

**Results to Highlight:**

**Overall Score: 34/100**
> "This scores very low. Let's see what the AI caught..."

**Radar Chart:**
- Climate: 60 (neutral)
- Social: 15 (severe issues)
- Cultural: 40
- Ethical: 22 (major problems)

**Key Findings to Read:**
- **Social:** "Before/after imagery perpetuates body shaming and unrealistic standards"
- **Social:** "Messaging links self-worth to weight: 'uncomfortable in your own skin', 'feel beautiful'"
- **Ethical:** "Vague efficacy claims: 'Drop pounds fast' without specific evidence"
- **Ethical:** "Fine print disclaimer undermines main claims"

**Talking Point:**
> "The AI identifies multiple problematic patterns: body shaming, emotional manipulation, pressure tactics, and vague claims. This would be flagged for review before publishing."

**Show Recommendations:**
> "Notice the recommendations focus on wellness vs. appearance, eliminating manipulation, and providing actual evidence."

---

### 5. Example 3: Mixed Signals (3 minutes)

**Select:** "Mixed: Electric Vehicle"

**Quick Analysis:**

**Overall Score: 68/100**
> "This is interesting - mixed signals. Good in some areas, concerns in others."

**Key Point:**
- **Climate (72):** "Promotes EV (good) but it's an SUV (concern)"
- **Ethical (65):** "'Zero emissions' could be misleading without charging source context"

**Talking Point:**
> "This shows the nuance. EVs are better than gas cars, but the messaging could be more transparent about lifecycle emissions and the fact that SUVs have higher impact than smaller vehicles. The AI catches this complexity."

---

### 6. Hungarian Language Demo (2 minutes)

**Select:** "Magyar: Fenntartható Divat"

**Show:**
- Automatic language detection
- Bilingual interface

---

### 7. Comparison Feature (2 minutes)

**Go to:** "Compare Ads" tab

**Show:**
- EcoThreads (91) vs SlimFit (34) vs EV (68)

---

### 8. Export & Reporting (1 minute)

**Show:** Export options
- PDF reports with charts

**Talking Point:**
> "Video analysis is our newest feature. It analyzes both visual content and audio, providing scene-by-scene insights and tracking how messaging evolves over time. This catches things like fast disclaimers or tone shifts."

---

### 10. Transparency & Limitations (2 minutes)

**CRITICAL - Don't Skip This:**

> "Now, let me be transparent about limitations. This is important."

**Key Points:**

**1. Validation Status:**
> "We're in research phase. Scores are directionally accurate but not validated for absolute precision yet. We're conducting expert panel studies over the next 6 months."

**2. What It Is:**
- Research tool for insights
- Directional compass, not precise ruler
- Identifies issues for human review

**3. What It's NOT:**
- Not regulatory compliance tool
- Not replacement for human judgment
- Not ready for public brand rankings yet

**4. Use Cases:**
> "Best for: Internal assessment, tracking progress, identifying red flags, learning from best practices."

> "Not ready for: Public rankings, legal defense, competitive attacks."

**Show Document:**
> "We have comprehensive documentation on methodology, confidence levels, and validation strategy. Full transparency on what we know and don't know."

---

### 11. Validation Roadmap (1 minute)

**Show Timeline:**

```
NOW → 3 MONTHS → 6 MONTHS → 12 MONTHS
⚠️     🟡        🟢         🟢
Research  Validated  Industry  Certified
```

**Explain:**
> "We're investing €65-110K in validation over 12 months. Expert panels, industry benchmarking, academic peer review. Goal is to make this an industry-standard tool with proven accuracy."

---

### 12. Questions & Discussion (Remaining time)

**Common Questions - Be Ready:**

**Q: "How accurate is it?"**
> "Direction: High confidence. Ranking: Medium. Exact scores: Being validated. We know it distinguishes good from bad ads reliably. We're validating the precise numbers with expert panels."

**Q: "Can we use this for compliance?"**
> "Not yet. It's a research tool that helps identify potential issues, but regulatory compliance requires legal review. Think of it as a first pass that flags things for expert review."

**Q: "What if it's wrong?"**
> "That's possible, which is why we require human review. We're transparent about limitations and tracking errors to improve accuracy. This is exactly why we're doing rigorous validation."

**Q: "How does it compare to manual review?"**
> "It's faster (seconds vs. hours) and more consistent (same framework always). But it's a complement, not a replacement. Best used together: AI for scale and consistency, humans for nuance and final decisions."

**Q: "Can we test our own ads?"**
> "Absolutely. That's the best way to evaluate if it's useful for you. We can set up a pilot with 50-100 of your ads and gather feedback."

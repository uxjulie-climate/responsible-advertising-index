# RAI Confidence & Accuracy
## Executive Summary for Stakeholders

---

## The Key Question

> **"How do we know these scores are right?"**

**Short Answer:** We don't yet - but we have a clear path to find out.

---

## Current Status: Research Phase ⚠️

| What We Know | Confidence |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Direction** (good vs. bad ads) | 🟢 High |
| **Relative Ranking** (compare ads) | 🟡 Medium |
| **Absolute Scores** (exact numbers) | 🔴 Low |

**Bottom Line:** Trust the direction, not the decimals.

---

## What RAI Does Well Today

### ✅ Directional Analysis
- Sustainable ads consistently score 80-95
- Problematic ads consistently score 30-50
- System reliably distinguishes responsible from irresponsible

### ✅ Issue Detection
- Catches obvious greenwashing
- Identifies stereotypes and representation gaps
- Flags manipulative language
- Recognizes transparency issues

### ✅ Comparison
- Can rank ads relative to each other
- Useful for "before/after" assessments
- Helps identify best practices

---

## What We Don't Know Yet

### ❌ Precise Accuracy
- Is 85 truly "better" than 82?
- What's the margin of error?
- How close to human expert ratings?

### ❌ Edge Cases
- Subtle greenwashing detection
- Cultural nuance understanding
- Industry-specific context
- Regional regulatory variations

### ❌ Long-term Consistency
- Scores stable over time?
- Results reproducible?
- Model updates impact?

### 3-Phase Validation

**Phase 1: Internal (Months 1-2)**
- Test 100 ads for consistency
- Measure score variance
- Document baseline reliability
- **Deliverable:** Internal validation report

**Phase 2: Expert Panel (Months 2-4)**
- 5-10 experts rate same ads
- Compare AI vs. human scores
- Calculate agreement metrics
- **Deliverable:** Expert validation study

**Phase 3: Industry Benchmark (Months 4-6)**
- Compare with regulatory rulings
- Test with brand partners
- Academic peer review
- **Deliverable:** Industry benchmark report

## Accuracy Metrics We'll Track

### 1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
**What:** Average difference between AI and expert scores
**Target:** < 10 points
**Meaning:** If MAE is 8, AI score ±8 points from expert average

### 2. Classification Accuracy
**What:** % of ads correctly classified as good/bad
**Target:** > 85%
**Meaning:** Catches 85% of problematic ads, doesn't false-alarm

### 3. Rank Correlation
**What:** How well AI ranking matches expert ranking
**Target:** > 0.75 (strong correlation)
**Meaning:** System puts ads in approximately correct order

### 4. Test-Retest Reliability
**What:** Consistency when analyzing same ad multiple times
**Target:** ± 5 points
**Meaning:** Same ad gets similar score each time

---

## Known Limitations (Be Transparent)

### AI Model
- May "hallucinate" elements not present
- Trained on Western-centric data
- Better at English than other languages
- Non-deterministic (small score variations)

### Framework
- "Greenwashing" is subjective spectrum
- Cultural norms vary by region
- Missing context (brand history, market)
- Doesn't verify factual claims

### Data
- No validated "ground truth" dataset yet
- No regulatory compliance check
- No legal framework integration
- Limited to what's visible in ad

---

## How to Use RAI Today

### ✅ DO Use For:

**Internal Brand Assessment**
- Compare our ads year-over-year
- Identify improvement areas
- Directional progress tracking

**Red Flag Detection**
- "Does this have obvious issues?"
- "Should we review this more carefully?"
- "Are we missing something?"

**Relative Comparison**
- "Which campaign was more responsible?"
- "What can we learn from leaders?"
- "How do we compare to last year?"

### ❌ DON'T Use For:

**Public Brand Ranking**
- "Brand X scored 65/100" ← Too precise, not validated

**Regulatory Defense**
- "RAI says we're compliant" ← Not a legal tool

**Competitive Attacks**
- "Competitor's ad scores badly" ← Unethical, unvalidated

**Absolute Judgments**
- "This is greenwashing" ← Needs human review

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| **False Positives** (flag good ad as bad) | Medium | Medium | Human review required |
| **False Negatives** (miss bad ad) | Medium | High | Validate with experts |
| **Score Over-interpretation** | High | Medium | Clear communication of limitations |
| **Reputation Risk** (wrong scores public) | Low | Very High | Keep scores internal until validated |

## Recommendations for Telekom Demo

### Messaging Framework

**What to Say:**
✅ "AI-powered research tool that analyzes ads across 4 responsibility dimensions"
✅ "Provides directional insights to identify potential issues"
✅ "Helps compare ads and track progress over time"
✅ "Currently in research phase with ongoing validation"

**What NOT to Say:**
❌ "Definitive scores of advertising quality"
❌ "Replaces human expert judgment"
❌ "Regulatory compliance tool"
❌ "Industry standard benchmark"

### Positioning

> **"The Responsible Advertising Index is a research tool that uses AI to analyze advertising content across four key dimensions: Climate, Social, Cultural, and Ethical responsibility. The system provides directional insights and helps identify areas for improvement. Scores are currently in research phase and should be validated by human experts before any public use or decision-making."**

### Demo Script

**Opening:**
"This tool helps us analyze advertising at scale. It's not perfect, but it gives us a systematic way to evaluate responsibility across thousands of ads."

**During Analysis:**
"The system provides scores from 0-100, but think of these as directional indicators rather than precise measurements. The real value is in the findings - specific issues the AI identifies."

**Closing:**
"We're currently validating these scores with expert panels and industry benchmarks. The goal is to create a trusted standard for responsible advertising over the next 6-12 months."

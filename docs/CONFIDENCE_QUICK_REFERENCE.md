## The Answer in 30 Seconds

**Q: "How do we know these scores are right?"**

**A:** "We know they're directionally accurate - the system reliably distinguishes good from bad ads. But we haven't validated the precise numbers yet. That's why we're in research phase with a 6-month validation plan using expert panels and industry benchmarks. Think of scores as a compass, not a ruler - they point the right direction but aren't millimeter-precise."

## Current Confidence Levels

| Aspect | Confidence | What This Means |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Direction** | 🟢 **HIGH** | Good ads score high, bad ads score low |
| **Ranking** | 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Can compare ads to each other |
| **Exact Scores** | 🔴 **LOW** | 82 vs. 85 not validated |
| **Findings** | 🟡 **MEDIUM** | Issues identified are relevant |
| **Consistency** | 🟡 **MEDIUM** | ±5 points typical variance |

## If Someone Challenges You

**"Can you prove it's accurate?"**
→ "Not yet, that's why it's research phase. We're conducting expert validation studies over the next 6 months."

**"What if it's wrong?"**
→ "That's possible, which is why we require human review and are transparent about limitations."

**"Why should I trust it?"**
→ "Trust the direction and the systematic approach. Don't trust absolute precision until validation is complete."

**"Is this just AI hype?"**
→ "No, it's a research tool with a clear validation roadmap. We're being honest about what we know and don't know."

## Demo Talking Points

### Opening:
"This tool helps analyze ads systematically. It's in research phase, so scores are directional, not definitive."

### During Demo:
"Notice how it identifies specific issues - that's the real value. The scores are helpful for comparison, but require validation."

### Closing:
"We're validating with experts over the next 6 months. Goal is industry-standard tool with proven accuracy."

## Red Flags to Avoid

❌ Claiming "99% accurate"
❌ Saying "scientifically proven"
❌ Promising "regulatory approval"
❌ Comparing to competitors publicly
❌ Making legal claims based on scores

---

## Green Lights (Safe Claims)

✅ "Research tool for insights"
✅ "Directionally accurate"
✅ "Currently validating with experts"
✅ "Helps identify improvement areas"
✅ "Transparent about limitations"

## The Honest Positioning

> "RAI is an AI-powered research tool that provides directional insights into advertising responsibility. Scores help identify potential issues and compare ads relatively, but aren't validated for absolute judgments yet. We're conducting rigorous validation studies over the next 6 months to establish accuracy benchmarks. Use with human expert review for any important decisions."

## Emergency Contact

**If someone asks technical questions you can't answer:**
→ "Great question. Let me connect you with our technical team who can provide detailed methodology documentation."

**If someone wants to use for public ranking:**
→ "We recommend waiting for validation completion in 6 months. For now, it's best used internally."

**If someone spots an obvious error:**
→ "Thank you! This helps our validation. Please document it - we're tracking these to improve accuracy."

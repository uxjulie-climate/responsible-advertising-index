```

**Why this scores medium:**

- Vague language ("balancing," "committed")
- "Clean technology research" - what specifically?

## CREATING YOUR OWN

**Template for testing new scenarios:**

```
Brand: [Name]
Product/Service: [What they sell]

Ad Copy:
[Headline]

[Body copy with specific claims]

[Call to action]

[Hashtags if relevant]
```

**Then ask yourself:**
1. Climate: Any sustainability claims? Specific or vague? Greenwashing?
2. Social: Who's shown/mentioned? Any stereotypes? Inclusive?
3. Cultural: Any cultural references? Respectful? Appropriate?
4. Ethical: Claims truthful? Manipulative tactics? Transparent?

Adjust the copy to test different scoring scenarios!
